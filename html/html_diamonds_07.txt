#Testing for Web Storage Support

Both localStorage and sessionStorage are attributes of the window object. 
We can test for browser support by testing whether these attributes are undefined:

	if( typeof window.localStorage == 'undefined' ){
    		// Use something other than localStorage.
	} else {
    		// Save a key-value pair.   
	}

Testing for sessionStorage works similarly; use typeof window.sessionStorage == 'undefined' instead. 
Typically, though, if a browser supports localStorage it also supports sessionStorage, and vice versa.


#To add an item to local storage or session storage, we need to use the setItem method. 
This method accepts two arguments: 
	key and value, in that order. 

Both arguments must be strings, or be converted to strings:

localStorage.setItem(keyname, value);

#Retrieving Values With localStorage.getItem()

To retrieve the value of a key, we use localStorage.getItem(). 
This method accepts one argument, the key of the value weâ€™d like to retrieve, which must be a string.
