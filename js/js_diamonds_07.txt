- Garbage collection is performed automatically. We cannot force or prevent it.
  The basic garbage collection algorithm is called “mark-and-sweep”.

- Objects are retained in memory while they are reachable.

- Being referenced is not the same as being reachable (from a root): a pack of interlinked objects can become unreachable as a whole.

Modern engines implement advanced algorithms of garbage collection.

A general book “The Garbage Collection Handbook: The Art of Automatic Memory Management” (R. Jones et al) covers some of them.
