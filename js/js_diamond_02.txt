	1) An operand – is what operators are applied to. For instance in multiplication 5 * 2 there are two operands: the left operand is 5, and the right operand is 2. Sometimes people say “arguments” instead of “operands”.

	2) An operator is unary if it has a single operand. For example, the unary negation - reverses the sign of the number:
	
	let x = 1;
	x = -x;
	alert( x ); // -1, unary negation was applied

	3) An operator is binary if it has two operands.
