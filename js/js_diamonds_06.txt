Computed properties:

1) We can use square brackets in an object literal.
That’s called computed properties.

######################
ex1: 

let fruit = prompt("Which fruit to buy?", "apple");

let bag = {
  [fruit]: 5, // the name of the property is taken from the variable fruit
};

alert( bag.apple ); // 5 if fruit="apple"
########################

The meaning of a computed property is simple: 
[fruit] means that the property name should be taken from fruit.

----

2) Two objects are equal only if they are the same object.

########################

let a = {};
let b = {}; // two independent objects

alert( a == b ); // false

########################

3) Cloning and merging, Object.assign
   To make a “real copy” (a clone) we can use Object.assign or _.cloneDeep(obj).

4) Additional operators:

-To delete a property: delete obj.prop.
-To check if a property with the given key exists: "key" in obj.
-To iterate over an object: for(let key in obj) loop.
