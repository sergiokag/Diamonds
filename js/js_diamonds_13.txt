# Strings

	In JavaScript, the textual data is stored as strings.
	There is no separate type for a single character.

	The internal format for strings is always UTF-16, 
	it is not tied to the page encoding.

	## Special characters
		\b	Backspace
		\f	Form feed
		\n	New line
		\r	Carriage return
		\t	Tab
	
	## String length
		console.log( `My\n`.length );  // 3
		
		Note that \n is a single “special” character,
		so the length is indeed 3.

	To get a character, use: [].
	To get a substring, use: slice or substring.
	To lowercase/uppercase a string, use: toLowerCase/toUpperCase.
	To look for a substring, use: indexOf, or includes/startsWith/endsWith for simple checks.
	To compare strings according to the language, use:
		 localeCompare, otherwise they are compared by character codes.
	There are several other helpful methods in strings:

	str.trim() – removes (“trims”) spaces from the beginning and end of the string.
	str.repeat(n) – repeats the string n times.
